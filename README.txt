##### README FILE  ######

This is a script that will login to the audible.com, go to link you input
and it will return html of the link you input. You can implement this in your script
by coping files from the scraper folder in folder where your bs4 code is.

###
IMPORTANT:
In order for script to work please put your mail and password in acc.py file
And you need to have firefox installed in your system

IF YOU ARE RUNING THE SCRIPT FOR THE FIRST TIME, OR HAVING SOME ERRORS PLEASE RUN run_me_first.py
AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS

###

###

SUGGESTION TO IMPLEMENT THE CODE IN YOUR CODE:

	In head of the code input this line:
	####

	from get_html import html_g

	####

	To get the html you can add this in your code before using soup:
	###

	html = html_g()

	###


	than you can use bs4 to scrap the page.
